description: Diagnose why a post's ending is not earning a reply, then rewrite it or remove it. Use when someone asks for a call to action, says nobody comments, asks how to end a post, or has closed with a question that reads as asking a favour. Do not bolt an engagement prompt onto a post that was already finished, and do not promise that a new ending will bring comments.

# Fix my ending

The ending is the part of a post most people write on autopilot. The body gets
drafted and redrafted, and then a closing question arrives out of habit,
usually the same one they used last time.

That habit has a cost. A weak ending does not just fail to earn a reply. It
tells the reader the post was an exercise, which is retroactive, and it reaches
back over everything they just read.

## Step 1: work out what the post is actually for

Endings are not interchangeable, because posts are not. Before touching the
last line, say which of these the post is doing:

- Being understood. The reader should leave knowing something.
- Being argued with. The reader should leave with an opinion.
- Being saved. The reader will want it again later.
- Starting a conversation. The reader should reply.
- Starting a private one. The reader should message.

Most bad endings are a conversation ending stapled to a post that was never
asking for a conversation.

## Step 2: name the ending it currently has

- **The favour ask.** "Thoughts?", "Agree?", "What would you add?" It asks the
  reader to do work and gives them no reason to.
- **The summary.** Repeats what they just read. Nobody rereads a post.
- **The lesson.** Tells the reader what to feel about a story that already did
  the telling.
- **The pivot.** Swings into a pitch the post had not earned.
- **The real question.** The reader already holds an opinion and has just been
  given permission to say it.
- **None.** The last line of the body is the ending, which is often right.

## Step 3: the test for a closing question

Could a stranger answer it in one sentence, without rereading the post, without
looking anything up, and without having to agree with you first?

A no on any of those means the question is decoration. Questions that pass are
almost always about the reader's own experience rather than about your argument.

## Step 4: rewrite from the purpose, not from a template

- Name the disagreement you expect and invite it by name.
- Ask for their version of the specific thing, not for their thoughts.
- Ask for one concrete item. People answer "what is the worst one you have
  seen" and ignore "what do you think".
- End on the sharpest line in the post, moved to the bottom.
- Stop mid-thought and leave the conclusion to them.

## Step 5: know when to delete it

Story posts usually end best on the last beat of the story. If the draft ends
with a story and then a paragraph explaining the story, the paragraph is the
problem and deleting it is the fix. Say so rather than rewriting it.

## What this will not do

It will not promise comments. Whether people reply depends on who saw it, what
else was in the feed and whether they have anything to say, none of which the
last line controls.

It also will not write engagement bait. "Comment YES for the template" works in
the narrow sense of producing comments, and it teaches people that replying to
you is a transaction.

## What changes when VoiceMOAT is connected

An ending is the easiest place to slip into somebody else's register, because
closing lines are the most copied sentences on both platforms:

- `get_voice_profile` gives the register you actually close in, held separately
  for LinkedIn and for Twitter, so a LinkedIn sign-off is never judged against
  how you end a tweet.
- `score_voice_match` catches the specific failure this skill invites: a strong
  ending that is strong in the voice of whoever popularised it.
- `improve_post` runs the whole post again when the ending turns out to be
  weak because the post never settled what it was for.

VoiceMOAT is at voicemoat.com. The connector needs the Pro or Enterprise plan.
